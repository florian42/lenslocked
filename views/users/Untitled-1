# OpenShift for Developers

## Routing HTTP Requests

- External clients access applications through the OpenShift routing layer.
- The data object behind the layer is the Route.
- HAProxy is the default OpenShift router
- It uses the HTTP header of the incoming request to determine where to proxy the connection.

## Source-to-Image (S2I)

- Deploy an application direct from source code hosted in a remote Git repository.
